# Automation

Java project has been committed to Git as per the assignment.

Use of libraries
1. Selenium webdriver
2. TestNG
3. Chromedriver



Furthure improvement could be 
  1. Use of excel sheets for data. Currently, data is being passed through dataprovider class keeping in view of simplicity of assignment. 
  2. Use of Listner classes for making reports more interactive and detailed. 
  3. Use of RetryAnalyzer to run failed test cases again in case if failed due to slowness.
